# Philosophy

link to book

## Consciousness Programming

non duality
start with reality/experience as axiomatic
go from there

## An Ethical Virus

bridge between mind and other abstractions
don't understand consequences of what we program
reality is a network of agents

## Everything is Programming

we are programming systems that are aware of ourself
we can change our own minds as well as others
need a unified way of dealing with all change, not just w/computers

## Accessible Change

# Defining Reality
