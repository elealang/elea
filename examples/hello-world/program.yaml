# Use unicode symbol terms or some other 
# syntax to formally denote the types of things
before:
  # Assume Elea:abs
  # how to do this? need computer computer
  - Elea

# The Hello, World program is really a story of Elea computation
# since we use Elea to build the program
# So for Elea programs, we simply assume Elea and interpet the
# program with some Elea computer
# the resulting mutations form the hello world abstraction
story:
  id: hello-world
  computers:
  - new-abstraction-default 
  - new-state-default 
  - new-arrow-default 

proofs:
  - composition: hello-world
    casuality: ''
